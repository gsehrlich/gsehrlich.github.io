<h3>Quantum Tunneling through the Iron Curtain:<br>
How Max Born's Ideology Influenced his Marxist Refutation of Violent Revolution</h3><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b><br><br>
Physicist Max Born experienced the communist ideology in its adolescence, and its effect on his ideology diverted him from an unbiased approach to the interpretation of quantum mechanics. In 1953, physicist L&eacute;on Rosenfeld published an article that Born interpreted as arguing that the history behind the development of the complementarity principle validated the Marxist doctrine of dialectical materialism. Born objected and, in 1955, composed a response in which he analyzed the definition of dialectical materialism given in a topical pamphlet by Stalin. Stalin used his definition to argue that violent revolution was unavoidable and was necessary for establishing a communist state. Born's paper indicates poor research; he fills the resulting gaps in knowledge with misinterpretations that represent the influence of his bias on his work. In particular, Born fails to distinguish between Rosenfeld's and Stalin's definitions of dialectical materialism, and as a result he implicitly concatenates their arguments to produce a derivation of the necessity of violent revolution from the history of the complementarity principle. Born accepts socialist ethics but rejects Marxist economic principles, and as a result he objects to violent revolution. Born's attack on dialectical materialism is motivated by the necessity to disprove this imagined argument and justify his objection.<br><br><br>

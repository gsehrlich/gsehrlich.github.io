			<p><b>
				Trained, experienced, and motivated tutor for physics and math for middle school, high school, college, and beyond
			</b></p>
			<p>
				<b>Gabriel majored in Physics at Stanford</b> and received his Bachelor of Science with distinction. His education began with classical mechanics and grew to include electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and all of the mathematics required to formulate these theories: linear algebra, tensor calculus, and partial differential equations. He has applied his knowledge towards research in theoretical astrophysics and experimental laser physics.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Gabriel is an experienced and practiced tutor.</b> Gabriel served for three years as a peer tutor for Stanford's Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL), where he helped other Stanford students gain the knowledge, skills, and confidence to achieve their goals in physics and math classes. As one of CTL's lead tutors his final year, he helped organize and train the junior  peer tutors. Outside of CTL, Gabriel has worked with tutees privately at the middle school and high school levels. He has also designed and taught curriculum through Stanford: student-initiated <a href="https://physics91si.stanford.edu">Python programming courses</a> for scientists, <a href="https://stanfordesp.org/teach/teachers/gehrlich/bio.html">Splash! weekend classes</a> for high school students, and >a course on black holes for his dormitory community. Gabriel has bolstered and informed his tutoring and teaching with classes at Stanford's Graduate School of Education.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Gabriel's approach to effective tutoring</b> is informed by his training, experience, and knowledge of education research. Gabriel  always focuses on the questions that the tutee finds most pressing or interesting, teaches the tutee tools for discovering solutions and taking ownership of the field's knowledge, and provides the tutee with motivation and support so that learning is a joy.

<b>The Roller Coaster Problem</b><br><br>
I made an assumption during the roller coaster problem that wasn't very accurate: the coaster is going essentially vertically. If the track is vertical, the roller coaster is unpowered, and there's no friction, then the rider will be in an inertial frame ascending or descending. If the hill is slanted instead, then the cart will have to exert some upward force on the rider, so he will not be in an inertial frame.<br><br>
As for the hill, whether the rider is in an inertial frame all depends on how fast she's going. It has to do with something called centripetal force, which (for example) is the sideways force that a car needs to exert on its riders as the car rounds a bend. As long as the gravitational force on the rider is equal to the centripetal force needed to keep her following the curve of the track, she will be in an inertial frame. That inertial frame is associated with a particular velocity. If the velocity of the roller coaster is greater than that, the rider will feel the pull of the restraining bars. If it's less, she will feel the push of the seat.<br><br><br>
<b>Underwater Sound</b><br><br>
Sound in still water should have exactly the same pitch as sound in still air. It is true that the speed of sound in water is different, but that does not affect the pitch of sound. Let's say we have some soundtrack that plays a cymbal crash every second. It doesn't matter how quickly the cymbal crashes travel to reach the listener's ears; he will always hear them one second apart. Likewise, a pitch with a particular frequency will emit compressions at regular intervals, and the listener will hear the same intervals and therefore the same pitch.<br><br>
"But what about helium?" A quick online search indicated that helium changes the timbre (pronounced "TAM-burr") of the speaker's voice, not the pitch. The helium accentuates the higher-pitched range of sound, so even though the fundamental frequency is the same, the speaker's voice sounds higher.<br><br><br>

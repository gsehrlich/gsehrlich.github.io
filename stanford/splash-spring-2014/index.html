<b>What is Recursion?</b><br><br>
Thanks to Colin for this question!<br><br>
If you Google &ldquo;recursion&rdquo;, you'll notice (apart from that it tells you &ldquo;Did you mean: recursion?&rdquo;) that most of the results are about computer science. That's because, at its heart, recursion is a problem-solving technique: &ldquo;follow a set of directions to reduce the problem to an easier one; then do it again and again until you've reached a version of the problem that you've already solved.&rdquo;<br><br>
Here's an example of a problem you've probably heard before that has a recursive solution: given a whole number, how do we know if it is divisible by 3? Let's take the number 238420934. The usual technique is to add up the digits and see if the result is divisible by 3, so let's do that: 2 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 9 + 3 + 4 = 35. Is this divisible by 3? Before answering, notice what we've accomplished so far: we took the question &ldquo;Is 238420934 divisible by 3?&rdquo;, the harder problem, and replaced it by the question &ldquo;Is 35 divisible by 3?&rdquo;, a much easier problem. The add-all-the-digits technique (which you can prove works) claims that the answer to the harder question is the same as the answer to the easier question. Making a replacement like this is called taking one <b>recursive step</b>.<br><br>
Now we haven't answered the question yet, but that's easy enough: we can reduce our easier question to an even easier question: apply the rule again! 3 + 5 = 8, so we can replace &ldquo;Is 35 divisible by 3?&rdquo; by &ldquo;Is 8 divisible by 3?&rdquo; We definitely know the answer to this one: no. Therefore 238420934 is not divisible by 3. Notice that we kept applying the recursive step until we reached a problem we already knew how to answer, the <b>base case</b>. Now we can define <b>recursion</b> properly: <i>a procedure in which one applies a recursive step over and over until one reaches a base case.</i><br><br>
What would have happened if we tried to apply the recursive step one more time, instead of using a base case? We want to know if 8 is divisble by 3, so we add up the digits of the number 8, yielding... 8. We haven't reduced the problem at all! If we try to use the recursive step here, we'll go in circles forever. This circularity is often called recursion, but it's really recursion gone wrong. This is what Google is referring to when it asks &ldquo;Did you mean: recursion?&rdquo;<br><br>
Colin's question arose out of reading Douglas Hofstadter's book <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach</i>. Hofstadter likes to use the word &ldquo;recursion&rdquo; to refer to recursion gone wrong, just like Google, but more importantly he uses the word to refer not just to a kind of procedure but to a kind of <i>pattern</i>. In a way, the easier problem is recursively &ldquo;inside of&rdquo; the harder problem; from that perspective, recursion is present in any pattern in which similar versions to the outer pattern appear inside the pattern itself. When the pattern contains itself <i>identically</i>, Hofstadter calls it a <b>tangled hierarchy</b>. (An example of a tangled hierarchy is a pattern of arrows or other things that can point, and when these things point to themselves, this is called a <b>strange loop</b>. (From another perspective, by the way, tangled hierarchies are actually examples of strange loops, if we draw the hierarchy as a pattern of arrows, each of which points to the arrow outside of it. Note that &ldquo;Tangled hierarchies are examples of strange loops, which are examples of tangled hierarchies&rdquo; is itself a tangled hierarchy. (Or perhaps I should say it's a strange loop.))) It seems to me that for Hofstadter, recursion is less a problem-solving technique than a way of looking at the world.<br><br><br>
